{{company}},

I love to program! The feeling of solving a programming issue that has kept you up until 2 in the morning is one of the greatest feelings in the world. I am especially enamored with android programming. I spend a lot of my free time coding and learning about android (as well as python/django, good Object Oriented and software design practices). 

In my current position as a Software Test Engineer, I have obtained a good understanding of agile software development practices. I also realize the value (and avoiding possible loss of profit and customer satisfaction) of having highly tested software. 

My love of android programming coupled with my automated testing experience, are the two main reasons that I feel that I am a good fit for this job.
